Why only to scientists and engineers? The intended audience is somewhat educated and used to perform scientific experiments and to work with data, but with a feeling that the translation of data into conclusions and decisions can still be improved. Hence, scientists and engineers. Other profiles, such as people with degrees in Economics or Finances or people not having enjoyed any higher education but with a good scores on mathematics, might also benefit. "],["about-this-course.html", "About this course", " About this course I will attempt to explain everything that is not part of common knowledge, i.e. everything not covered during secondary education, and more. I will pay attention to those with a fear for formulae1. The exercises are not optional for those who whish to ascertain that they grasped the content. With fear for formulae, I am intentionally not referring to an disability such as Dyscalculia because these typically include multiple other symptoms. With the fear of furmulae, I mean the ability to comprehend abstract ideas despite having difficulties understanding the symbolism of the author. While formulae have their benefits, I have learned that mathematical notation and symbolism is not always as exact and unambiguous as I used to believe. I will therefor use formulae only where needed and go the extra mile to explain all the symbols and terms used.↩︎ "],["statistics.html", "Chapter 1 Statistics", " Chapter 1 Statistics Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics. The term comes from the german word for the doctrine in which the state is put into numbers and allegedly introduced by Gottfried Achenwall in 1749 as a part of Staatswissenschaft (Political arithmetic). The discipline is probably older and depending on what is currently being regarded as statistics, it could be traced back to the earliest cuneiform writings . "]]
